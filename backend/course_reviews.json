Each class was either a discussion in breakout rooms and in the main room, or an in class screening. Prof. Chang was very knowledgable and always gave space for students to discuss. I took this class during the surge of anti-Asian sentiment and he changed the curriculum in order to talk more about these current issues. Writing wise, there were bi-weekly discussion posts, and 3 mid-length essays, which weren't bad at all."

The workload is not terribly demanding, more like weekly cases studies and busywork assignments (the semester I took the course we used a flipped classroom set-up). The professor occasionally brought in past students (who work at places like L'oreal) to give talks."

Exams are online and open notes but really hard and you do not get the answers back so you are not able of analyzing your mistakes and learn from them.

If you have prior understanding of quantum mechanics and photonics then you're chillin as well. It's shocking how many kids in my class actually had that background, and the curve of the class is skewed to that as well. \n\nI came in with very weak understanding of physics and alright with the math, and did not do amazing in the class. Avoid this course all costs if you do not have a technical background, but Prof Xu seems like a chiller.\n\nHomework is always really tough and has questions that have never been covered in lecture. It's a classic AEP style 'figure it out yourself or with your friends/TAs' and that is just the wrong approach to an ENGRI.

Prof Xu is a chill guy and really nice, but I cannot recommend especially if you come from a less-advantaged high school."

I didn't find the prelims to be that hard (although they were in class so we only had 50 minutes to complete them - it was a pretty nasty time crunch, and I never had time to check my work), but the average was very low (we were given points back and curved to a higher grade though)."

We had three prelims which were all easy. However, the final was quite difficult. My struggles and dislike of this class could be do to lack of effort, so take this as you will. Every other class in AEP is better tho."

Before each class, you watch a lecture video on 2x speed (about 25 min) and then Frank has a nice worksheet for you to work on with a group the next day. This method def helped me understand what was going on in the material, tho do not fall behind. If you do it is nearly impossible to recover (by the end of the class pretty much no one kept up, but it worked well for the first half). Very interesting class. Hw and tests are typical aep. Hw a little tougher and trickier (5 hours), tests more straightforward. Great class and Frank is an absolute beast."

Class is not too bad; sometimes the legal reasoning can get a little convoluted (especially in terms of tort law) so make sure you follow with the readings and lectures. Grade primarily is based on two hypothetical problem sets, in which you are presented with a set of facts and must apply legal reasoning/facts from cases in the readings to your own set of facts. Would suggest you go to office hours for assistance as these are graded pretty harshly. Overall, the class is not impossible but make sure you get help if you need it."

There are two case analysis homework assignments, occasional section meetings that substitute for lectures, and multiple-choice exams. Definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken."

The workload was better than most 3000-level class I've taken, which says a lot because this is a 4000-level senior seminar. Assigned about 100 pages of reading a week on a topic that we then spent class discussing. 50% of grade from weekly 1 page reactions to readings + class participation and 50% from a 20-page paper about effectively whatever you want. Median grade for class was an A."

A good amount of busy work that isn't very helpful such as literature reviews and the research proposal (or maybe that's just because I'm not interested in research).

Lectures can be long and dry but they didn't take up the full two hours most of the time if they did she gave us a 10-minute break in the middle. The workload is light, just a reading and response question once a week. Debbie is also very accommodating and caring, you can definitely go to her with any questions or concerns. Overall pretty easy two credits, I do recommend the course."

His slides are usually just figures from numerous papers he read, so it can be hard to figure out what we should get out of each class. There is an individual presentation. Make sure to take notes on each presentation as they are tested on the exams too. He does curve exams and allow for exam corrections to get back some lost points, so that was good. Overall the course content is interesting; he just needs to find a way to better present all the information."

This class was largely art-oriented and I highly recommend against taking it if you're uninterested in art. Professor Langwick seemed to give work in spurts, at some points throughout the semester we had very little, and at others, we were hit with a truck-load. Professor Langwick does seem slightly subjective when grading; basically, if she doesn't like your concepts/ideas you're probably not getting a great grade. The essays are very abstract regarding seemingly meaningless concepts. One of the more annoying things about this FWS is that there is a final project that gets presented during finals week, so be ready for an extra \"final.\" I'd avoid this class if possible."

It easily takes the spot of the hardest course in Cornell\u2019s entire B.Arch curriculum. Besides just having to carve out the time to devote to complete each week\u2019s problem set, the lectures do not cover nearly the same level of depth as problems on the homework, prelim, or final. If you would like to obtain above a C+, or B- in this class, I would highly suggest you prioritize studying structural mechanics on your own as early as possible. This can be done by outsourcing resources for civil engineering from other colleges or even universities or ideally recruiting the help of a tutor."

The class involves lots of readings but Prof. Krik expands upon the topics clearly in class. Exams are very similar to study guides, and the final project was open-ended and fun. Definitely not an \"easy\" class if you don't have much prior knowledge, but still learned a lot and did well without it!"

No prior knowledge is assumed and it's an easy A as long as you show up and put in your best effort. Also, this is one of the cheapest art classes and you won't have to spend much time in the studio outside of class."

There's very little work during the semester (just weekly readings) and 1-3 essays (including the final).

Meeting with her helps if you're stuck because she gives a lot of great ideas. Doesn't give much comment feedback on essays/drafts, so meet with her if you want more detailed feedback. For the final essay there was also a presentation that went with it, but I think it's there for the experience of presenting and isn't graded stringently. Overall fun and good FWS choice if you like movies/Korean culture!"

It was pretty easy to do well in this class since she's a really nice grader (I almost always ended up submitting it a few hours past the deadline and I still ended up with an A). The course content is pretty interesting but sometimes the readings can be long and boring. Don't go into this course thinking it's just about K-pop lol. There's a final presentation (group or solo) and it's pretty low stakes. BTW, she's a bit more strict about following an essay writing structure that she wants so it can get annoying if you're more creative/don't like to follow some cookie cutter outline for ur essays.\n\nOverall, courseload isn't too bad and we get to submit 1 or 2 drafts before submitting the final drafts of our essays."

However, the grading was very easy. There were a lot of readings, and they are interesting, but if you don't care about the course material you will probably do fine without taking them. One of the things I dislike is that the last few minutes of each class are dedicated to watching a (class-relevant) TV show - I feel like I'm kind of wasting lecture time watching this when I could see it outside of class."

The professor is super nice and accommodating (extensions etc...) and enjoys what he teaches. His voice is also very nice to listen too (I think he said he did narration for books before?).  The way the class works is that before every class there is some  amount of anime/manga/research articles you need to read. Note that the research papers are quite long but you don't need to really read the whole paper (just enough so you can do the weekly discussion and have substance for papers). Then each class is basically a lecture over that and a discussion. I don't believe participation is part of your grade (though I did take this when covid hit). Also no need to take notes really. In terms or workload, every week you watch a few episodes and then write a paragraph reflection post and respond to others' posts on canvas. In terms of larger assignments. There are 2 essays, a game journal,  creative project, one short vocab quiz. Originally, the project and final essay were worth 20% each but due to covid, the prof gave us the option to do one for 40% or both for 20% (again the due us super accommodating). The first essay is a shorter, essay where you  analyze animation techniques of your choice of some anime (forget which exactly). The final essay is longer and can be on any anime approved by the prof but the topic is largely the same (focusing on animation rather than plot). The final essay also needs more sources (the smaller essay needs some (1 i think?) but not too much). The creative project is fairly open ended.  The vocab quiz was very simple and if you are into anime, you probably know some of the terms.  In terms of grading, it is fairly lenient. If you do assignments with decent effort you should be able to get 90% or higher pretty easily.  Overall probably one of the funnest classes I have taken. Also it counts as GHB, CA-AS, ALC-AS. You are literally fulfilling 3 things with this one class if you are in A&S."

The professors are both clearly very invested in what they're teaching! Each week had a separate theme (one was tea ceremonies) and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about all of the topics. There's very little work during the semester (just weekly readings) and 1-3 essays (including the final). I wasn't too sure on what they were looking for on the papers but going into office hours was very helpful to see how I could improve for the final."

Probably could've grinded for a B/B+ if I was taking it graded. Most disorganized class I've taken at Cornell.  Take 1101 in the fall semester over this at all costs.  I'll just lay out problems I had with the class sentence by sentence. Professors didn't really seem to care about the class/didn't have time to make it well run(I get that they're NASA big shots or whatever and they've got a lot going on, but uh, they're the ones who chose to teach this class. Nobody is forcing them to do it).  I mean I think I saw Squyres (the head professor of the class) like once the last couple months of the semester. Really think him and Hayes (second professor) need to hand this class to someone else.  Was never clear what would show up on prelims.  Lectures were usually fairly interesting but often not all that related to prelims and homework. TAs grade short answers on the prelims very harshly.  Hayes is a weirdly hostile guy to talk to one on one.  TAs were a walking bafoonery show - unorganized and unhelpful sections.  Felt like a major disconnect between the professors and TAs where they never seemed to communicate with each other or be on the same page. Made for a class that constantly lacked cohesiveness. Weekly typos on homework and official papers. Important grading aspects of the class like section grade and homework grade were never clearly explained and were different from the syllabus. Won't say this is a \"hard\" class (for Cornell's standards) but it is not worth it in the slightest if you're a non-science major just looking to take an interesting class for an Arts credit. Take 1101 or Oceans."

Sometimes the meetings would go on for 10 minutes or 2 hours depending on how many assignments need to be completed.

I will say, with so many lecturers switching off, it was a little disorganized (lecturers didn't always know what was/wasn't covered before them) and the exams were often a bit vague and difficult to prepare for. The TAs are always very helpful though if you take the time to ask. Almost all of your grade is only based on two exams and one paper, so just be a little careful with that as well.

The lecturers alternate between units, so the quality of teaching fluctuates throughout the course. We were required to watch video lectures before each class (and answer quiz questions on them), which could be very time consuming. My biggest complaint is that they often waited until very soon before class to post the video lectures, so you had very little time to do them. Also, prelims were full of \"gotcha\" questions that made it hard to get a good score even if you understood the material and studied."

I think the concepts are both easier to grasp and more relating to lab procedures, which have explicit answers and are constantly explained within the lectures, and you can just go to OH to get your assignment answers checked over. The labs are mainly working with fruit flies and micropipetting/PCR/sequencing type procedures, and since I haven't done this too often, I found the labs not bad at all and sometimes kind of fun. Grading is slightly weird on the assignments since they are so specific in what they want from the free response answers, so even if you go to office hours, you may lose a few points here and there for the assignments. Finally, the class can be kind of repetitive, and when you start getting closer to the mid/end of the course, a lot of the concepts are just things you've already seen."

However, the course gets gradually easier just based on the subject matter, in that topics covered later are more interesting and generally easier to grasp. Specific professors are better than others; the best being Ron Harris-Warrick, Jesse Goldberg, and Melissa Warden. Watch the pre-lecture videos and complete pre-lecture assignments so that you are prepared for class, otherwise lecture will be confusing. iClicker questions are not graded for correctness, but just completion, so it pays to go to class even if you may not be particularly prepared. Lecture audio is recorded, which is a great way to fix up notes and study for exams. Weekly quizzes can be quite challenging, but going to study groups can help with these. Going to study groups also helps to remain up-to-date on information covered, as falling behind can be hard to come back from. I was enrolled in the 4-credit course that included a weekly discussion, which was sometimes annoying but worth the work, because prelims and the final exam are worth less percent of the final grade."

One of the best things about this class is how much there still is to learn so it's a great one for really starting to ask research questions.  I will say, with so many lecturers switching off, it was a little disorganized (lecturers didn't always know what was/wasn't covered before them) and the exams were often a bit vague and difficult to prepare for. The TAs are always very helpful though if you take the time to ask. Almost all of your grade is only based on two exams and one paper, so just be a little careful with that as well. Overall though a light workload but high information content class"

The material is super interesting and I would definitely recommend it to future doctors to learn more about how the role of medicine impacts society and culture. It is a good introduction to medical anthropology. However, this class is a lot of work. There were no prelims but all essays and readings every week. Professor Langwick doesn't allow laptops and she makes you print out the reading for every class and it is around 10 pages. It was bad for the environment. Also there are pop quizzes for the readings. I took it spring 2020 so the second half was impacted by COVID and there was a lot less work."

The weekly problem sets aren't too difficult especially if you go to office hours. Additionally, we had large group projects that weren't bad and our prelims had practice prelims that were super similar. We did transition online (spring 2020) and the professors were incredibly accommodating. I do have to say as some super into sustainability, it's more of the science behind it rather than \"trendier\" side of sustainability."

Who you're paired with for group quizzes can make or break the class, so don't be afraid to speak up if you're with people who aren't pulling their weight. Prelims are fairly straightforward and usually resemble the practice posted. Expect to put in a lot of time outside of class."

The exam questions are often pretty different from the discussion set problems, and definitely unlike the HW problems. One great thing is that the lectures are all recorded and posted on canvas within a day or two, which is very helpful.\n\nLabs are probably the worst part of this class. They are generally very long, and very repetitive. Lab TAs seem a bit out of tune with each other, often giving different advice and different answers to the same questions. \n\nDiscussions aren't all that helpful, just a TA going over discussion set problems that are already posted on canvas with answer keys. \n\nThe best part about this class is that the final isn't cumulative, it's a third prelim. Professor DiStasio offers \"mini prelims\" during this time slot as well, which are smaller versions of the first two prelims (of your choice) that you can try to get a better grade with. \n\nCompared to 2070, I'd say the workload is slightly less, and the class overall is slightly less intense, but the difficulty is about the same."

However, he's a bit behind schedule a lot of the time, and this makes the labs a bit difficult to grasp (we do an experiment on a concept we barely learned about). We don't get many practice problems for the prelims either.\nFor the lab portion, it is pretty difficult at first because a clear procedure is not given. Also, the TAs would sometimes have different answers for lab questions/procedures, so you need to ask multiple TAs for help."

The worst part about the class is the labs, as the TAs seem like they do not communicate with each other, and my TA would recommend one procedure but another TA at OH would tell me I approached it completely wrong."

I can only think of one lecture that he started and ended on time. Also, since he started lectures late and he has a tendency to ramble, it wasn't uncommon for lectures to last 30 minutes past the official end of class. Also, I stated above that the homework was the most helpful for me but my lord it was awful. There was way too much work assigned and the due dates were all over the place. He even assigned 56 new practice problems just four days before the start of Finals. Not cool :("

I did not attend lectures although they were enjoyable simply due to lack of time. Learning Analytics makes up 5% of the final grade so that is a tradeoff.\n\nThe problem sets take a long time because you have to teach yourself how to do everything. There are basically no office hours, no Ed. Redoing the problem sets and working through the released exam questions was enough to get the highest score on both prelims. If you learn how to do the questions, you can get ~100%, it's just a matter of how much time you have to study. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that the professor often released practice exams/solutions very late, and they were filled with errors. I was able to catch some of the errors, but I probably missed many more. Hard to learn when you aren't given correct solutions. Also, organization was poor. Sometimes homeworks were canceled or extensions were given AFTER the deadline had passed. \n\nThe labs were honestly fun! You get to work with a partner and it rarely if ever takes the whole 3 hours.\n\nI recommended the MIT principles of chemical science course as well as reading the textbook. The material and kinds of questions are honestly fun, the workload is just constant if you want to keep up, and much of it had to be self taught. Overall, I'll miss CHEM 2090 a little bit."

Nevertheless, the score distributions didn't change and students stopped showing up to lectures.

Labs are graded significantly after you do them, so you can't correct your lab for the next time. Even got deductions for not observing certain spectra peaks (how was I supposed to do that if they weren't there?). Course does not use Ed discussion which means you have to email to ask any questions at all. As a senior taking the course, this is a poor excuse of a Cornell class and much worse run than other large classes I've taken."

The prelims are challenging and hard to get a hold of because its testing you on lab concepts. The labs themselves are all kind of repetitive and the actual yields of your products don't matter like they did in gen chem labs because you can cite other students' data to use in your report. The reports are not as challenging as gen chem but they still suck. The key to this class is your TA. Clotide was the best TA and offered so much help and support!"

Labs generally take 2-3 hours to complete, but there are several people who leave early. Both the professor and the TAs were very helpful when I went to office hours for help on the lab reports or problem sets. There were 4 problem sets throughout the semester and they took around 30-40 minutes to complete. Most of the questions could be answered by looking at the lecture notes or Chemistry Libretexts. I felt that performing experiments in Chem 2510 reinforced my understanding of organic chemistry (especially the more complicated reaction mechanisms) in a way that the lectures did not. I wish I had taken this course in conjunction with CHEM 3580."

I'm honestly not sure if Lambert is just a terrible lecturer or the content at this point became extremely overwhelming, or both. Either way, once Lambert came in, the course became extremely difficult. His lectures felt a little unorganized, and his prelim was awful (48/100 average). He made up for it with an easier final, however. Both professors do seem to care about their students.

I went in wanting to transfer out to  beginner's Chinese because I only understood about 50$ of what everyone was saying. There's a bit of variation in how fluent everyone in this class - some people were basically fluent and (in my opinion) should've been in the intermediate class, while others were more like me. Professor Liu is super nice and understanding and since it's such a small class, we all get to know each other pretty well. \n\nWorkload - Meet 3x a week and we have a textbook that we follow, so every week we focus on a different lesson. Lots of memorization (about 50-70 terms to memorize by Friday - day of the quiz). You're expected to learn the vocab by yourself. Every week is basically like this: Mondays, submit recording of the lesson text before class and come to class ready to talk about the text. Wednesdays, 2-3 people doing their oral presentations & some grammar lessons. Fridays, quiz and go over textbook questions. Overall, if you put in the effort then you'll get at least a B+."

They were also just an exercise to get you to write more but it was incredibly stressful. Especially with such short notice. I do have to warn that if you don't like greek mythology and I mean REAL greek mythology NOT PERCY JACKSON, take this class. If not, it can be really draining.

As long as you attend lecture and review the content of each lecture before the prelim, it is not hard to get a good grade. The prelims are not cumulative, and there is also an extra credit option. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a liberal studies class that is easy and interesting."

Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable.

Lectures are hard to follow and he likes to ramble, and will occasionally lose his train of thought. However, the slides are also hard to understand, and there are no lecture notes (nor does he really follow the textbook), so you have to go to lecture. The class is quite disorganized, and homework/prelim grades took forever to be released. The class also seems to be focused much more on teaching how to use specific software tools to create/analyze linguistic models, rather than the theory behind how such software tools work (which is what I was more interested in). On the plus side though, he is rather lenient in giving final grades, so I still ended up with a B+ even though I kinda gave up on the class 2/3 through."

This class is very linguistics focused too and you use software mostly to do linguistics stuff EX: foma. The hard part is coming up with grammar etc..."

More than half the psets (which were actually coding projects except for a few written questions) took more than 20 hours, although the short ones took a range of 1 to 5 hours. There were 7 psets total.  This is a predominantly CS class although it's cross-listed in LING and COGST. The lectures were interesting, but the projects (psets) were extremely frustrating, and the professor and the TA gave out obscure answers when asking for help.  I'm also not sure how much I learned from the projects. I ended up with a good grade, which is based on the projects and some participation, but wouldn't have taken it if I had to choose again.  Definitely know a friend you can discuss with or get to know someone if you take the class."

The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been."

Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material."

The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP."

There are some benefits of taking this class over others, which mainly comes from having to watch films over reading books. The thing is, the class can also suck the joy out of watching films because it becomes a chore. There's a required film to watch once a week for roughly 11 weeks, with a 250 word review/response to the movie required once a week. This doesn't seem like much, and I acknowledge that you're probably thinking that I've never experienced a hard course in my life, but it takes a toll after a while. This is on top of the essays that are due every two weeks (total of 5 essays). I was already up to my ears in engineering courses and I had to manage to squeeze in time between writing lengthy lab reports and finishing up problem sets to sit down and analyze a film that was more than likely uninteresting and in a language I didn't speak or understand. No issue with other films in other languages EXCEPT for the fact that you're trying to read the subtitles while analyzing the scenes for things to write about and the two hour film suddenly turned into four hours. Outside of this, the essays are graded pretty fairly/easily, but it's hard to know what the grad students are looking for. If I have any advice to someone looking to take this class and is in a major that already has a great workload: read up on some filming techniques before class (or read the suggested books), really manage your time, and be very open minded. I'm grateful for all of the things I've learned and the people I've been able to discuss the film with (hence the high overall score), but the class was an added stress. On a side note: some people taking this class have already taken a film class before and will make your writing and contributions to class look like the thoughts of a 5 year old."

Despite going into detail on what the class entails, we were surprised day one when we were told that our first half of the semester would be Chinese Film, and then we would switch to world film. No problem with that, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT. Then they tell us that we will also be switching professors halfway through the course.  Week after week we are given feature length films followed by 250 word comments. The essay prompts are uninspired and lazy. The teachers: Keyun Tian and Junting Huang grade more like a STEM course than anything in COML. Often giving us 5 page essays the same weekend as a film and our weekly post, the teachers seem unconcerned by the workload and when it is assigned. Most notably, nearly all of our assignment are due on weekends. I would not reccomend this class to anyone who doesn't fit all of the following categories: speaks several languages fluently, prefers all of their worked focuses in a very short timespan, and unbearable 75 minute discussions week after week. Good luck. You'll need it"

She does put quite a bit of work into the class though. The discussions are useless, but you have to study the material learned there for the tests. The prelims are really hard, open book/notes, and have a time crunch, so they're pretty stressful, and the scores were pretty bad for both. They're kind of disproportionately difficult for the level of the class. As for workload, there were only three homework assignments the entire semester, and while they were kind of long they weren't very hard at all."

There are no tests, so you don't really need to learn any of the material. It's really just a bunch of speeches throughout the semester, which aren't very hard. That being said, the structure of the course is super annoying. You are forced to use an outline for several of your speeches, and then submit them (often two weeks or more before the actual speech is due) and wait for feedback. You get graded on the drafts you submit, too, so you have to actually put in effort. The pacing means that you often have to start work on your next speech before you've finished your current one. Overall, I wouldn't say I learned anything from this course. It pretty much just felt like doing assignments for credit."

There are three main units. Each one ends with a speech you have to present to a small group of your peers. I thought the speeches would be nerve wrecking, but Jodi is very efficient at preparing us and a very lenient grader. It is a very easy course if you come to class and lab and pay attention. Really not that much work outside of the speeches and there are only three. She really wants everyone to pass with a good grade and makes it as easy as possible to get that if you just put the effort into it."

The lectures are delivered in a sensible manner and his explanation is thorough; the textbook was almost completely absent from my routine but his online wiki more than make up for my learning process. However, the homework is cleverly written and a b**** to do, and the smug man knows it. It is absolutely the most difficult homework I have encountered at Cornell thus far and you are better off waiting for answers and explanations at OH than doing it with your partner or alone, and it doesn't help you to prepare for prelims and finals as those questions are hard but nowhere as tricky and tedious. Overall, this course is acceptable but it can definitely be more reasonable about its difficulty, but then it has \"weed-out\" written all over it so I am not surprised. Anybody who says it isn't hard is a flexing tryhard."

Prelims were standard CS exams and he provides practice problems which prepare you pretty well. Concepts are somewhat tricky to grasp at first, but I really enjoyed OCaml once I was familiar with it. It is a different way of thinking which will take a bit of time to get used to."

There were a few short and pretty easy homework, however, the projects were brutal. Half the time it was trying to figure out how to manipulate some equation to get where you wanted and the other half was trying to optimize your code so it ran quick enough. Pretty much everyone ended up going to office hours where the TA would start going through all the equations but it would still take forever to actually complete these projects. Then the final was also crazy. It was a take home final and over half the class spent over 25 hours on it."

The exams were written with trick questions and the networking project is an actual nightmare. Projects 1, 2, and 4 are usually the same every year and not bad but project 3 will literally crater your grade if you don't work on it for hours on end. The final is optional but you should take it unless you have an A in the class because a ton of people choose to take it to replace a prelim grade and the median in the class always goes up because of it. My year they used grade deflation too. CS majors you have to take it so oh well but otherwise just don't. and whatever you do DON'T TAKE THE PRAC. Unless you like torture."

The projects were a queue, user threads, MLFQ, cache, and filesystem. Each was interesting and fair but also a  fair share of work. I would set up regular meeting times with your partner of about 2 hours each and you should be good. The only bad part was that grading came very late in the semester for projects, but I don't think anyone did devastatingly poorly and didn't expect it."

Overall, manageable workload, good professors, interesting concepts, and definitely a class to take if you want to do low-level or kernel programming."

Our mentor told us we shouldn't choose any projects that have online tutorials and solutions available, but without any guidance online, my group had no clue how to start. It is true that you can do this all at the end of the semester, although it is not fun. My group procrastinated, mainly because no one knew what they were doing. In the end, I realized the project wouldn't get done unless I did it, so I coded it up by myself in less than a week. We ended up with an A-. \n\nBe warned, a lot of the final grade is based on what you do after completing the code: evaluation and a high level report. \n\nOverall, it was really annoying that we had no resources and office hours were so infrequent. Because of this, I am not walking away with a project I'm proud of. This class seems to be designed for seniors just looking to graduate and do the bare minimum. Make sure to find a good group or you will be extremely stressed out doing a semester-long project by yourself."

The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been."

Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material."

The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP."

Lectures are hard to follow and he likes to ramble, and will occasionally lose his train of thought. However, the slides are also hard to understand, and there are no lecture notes (nor does he really follow the textbook), so you have to go to lecture. The class is quite disorganized, and homework/prelim grades took forever to be released. The class also seems to be focused much more on teaching how to use specific software tools to create/analyze linguistic models, rather than the theory behind how such software tools work (which is what I was more interested in). On the plus side though, he is rather lenient in giving final grades, so I still ended up with a B+ even though I kinda gave up on the class 2/3 through."

More than half the psets (which were actually coding projects except for a few written questions) took more than 20 hours, although the short ones took a range of 1 to 5 hours. There were 7 psets total.  This is a predominantly CS class although it's cross-listed in LING and COGST. The lectures were interesting, but the projects (psets) were extremely frustrating, and the professor and the TA gave out obscure answers when asking for help.  I'm also not sure how much I learned from the projects. I ended up with a good grade, which is based on the projects and some participation, but wouldn't have taken it if I had to choose again.  Definitely know a friend you can discuss with or get to know someone if you take the class."

Though it's incredibly challenging (psets typically take a minimum of 10-15 hours, and going to office hours is usually necessary), the material can be really rewarding if you put in the due time. Kleinberg's lectures were very detailed, and generally clear, though sometimes he moves too quickly/doesn't explain things simply enough. Recommendations for the course would be to a) attend every lecture/watch them on videonote, b) read the textbook before lecture and definitely before doing the psets, and c) go to office hours for *every* pset. This class probably took me at least 15 hours a week, and I felt lost on the material pretty often. That being said, going to office hours and reading through the textbook made the class much more manageable! Also, no iClickers is a bonus."

Outside of the project, there is very minimal work, and lecture is not required (but Ross is super interesting!). I liked this class because it was small and had easy access to Ross, who is a great professor. Outside of the project, the deliverables are easy: small reflections, final presentation. Most people get A's I think."

Bindel was a really good lecture and he made amazing notes for every class. So even if you didn't go to class you still had all the info. There were a few short and pretty easy homework, however, the projects were brutal. Half the time it was trying to figure out how to manipulate some equation to get where you wanted and the other half was trying to optimize your code so it ran quick enough. Pretty much everyone ended up going to office hours where the TA would start going through all the equations but it would still take forever to actually complete these projects. Then the final was also crazy. It was a take home final and over half the class spent over 25 hours on it."

The organization of the course is a slight drawback because there is no Ed and communication occurs entirely in class and through an \"announcements\" section on the course website. The content is highly theoretical, so this is not a pentesting or learning to construct attacks, but more about learning security principles, protocols, and concepts. The first half of the class, the workload was 4 worksheets graded for completion, and the second half was a programming project that was slightly more involved, partially because it was specified at a very high level and assumes quite a bit of programming experience. The midterm was relatively challenging, but the final was optional if you completed all other parts of the course."

The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been."

Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material."

The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP."

The material is horrible and the teacher does not post anything she has made herself, just some videos of a Russian dude poorly explaining physics concepts. Why pay thousands of dollars to take a course where you're not taught by anyone and could just as well have worked through a textbook? Basically, this class is teaching yourself physics and doing some problems where you basically just guess and plug some numbers into formulas that you don't understand. The problem sets that are expected to take 1-2 hours usually take much longer because you're basically working through problems that you've never learned anything about. Everyone gets a perfect average on the homework because you can repeat them and try again, but the test averages are usually in the 60s and 70s and they are 30  of your grade. I'm going to get an A or A+ and literally don't understand a thing we have been taught. I just plug into formulas."

Professor Wyocki is not a bad lecturer, but has an extremely limited knowledge of Canvas, iClicker Reef, and apparently email. My grade has severely reflected this lack of organization on several occasions.  There is a good structure to the class as a whole, but resources on Canvas are very limited and unorganized, and I think the materials that ARE available are for a different class.  Homework does not accurately reflect lectures.  Additionally, there is  a lot of work for a 3 credit course.  The material itself is not too difficult if you already have basic physics knowledge."

Definitely go to the office hours with the TAs - if you don't have a lot of physics experience, it will be hard for you to go through the lessons on your own. I liked being able to go at my own pace and repeat the quizzes. However, I found some of the explanations in the lessons confusing and needed to look up extra materials to fully understand the topics. To succeed in this online class, you need to be self-motivated and organized - it's all too easy to fall behind and end up cramming all the lessons at the end. The physics topics covered are very interesting and applicable for environmental science students, but I think that a lot of them might be an higher level than beginner physics."

He goes over so many examples and really makes sure students understand the concepts. He allows for asking lots of questions. I took this course after taking the Python course. In this course you start with learning C in the first half, then you transition to C++. In this class, I felt like I like I learned so much. I learned about multi-paradigm programming - procedural, objected oriented, generic, functional and a little bit of concurrent programming. You also learn about static and dynamic polymorphism. Highly recommend this course with Christopher Batten."

Probably one of the best classes to take if you're ECE and want to learn software (for both software engineering jobs or even just as an ECE out and about in the field you should definitely know C and C++), or even a CS major who wants to learn C and C++. Batten is an amazing lecturer but he is also detailed orriented so you gotta make sure you check everything and really solidify your understanding of the material. You definitely come out a much better programmer, very confident in my abilities now.         BUT you go through war to get there. Just be prepared to grind through the reports at the end of each programming assignments. Exams are tough, but also if I showed up to class on time maybe they'd be aiight. If punctuality isn't your thing this class probably isn't for you."

I highly recommend going to office hours for this class, as the TAs can help clear up any confusion you have about what exactly to use to do any of the homework problems. Otherwise, it may take you hours to figure out how to solve a given problem. Also, start early on the homework, so you can get help when you get stuck."

I feel that the lectures were not very useful because they're reiterating material on the lecture notes. However, the lecture notes are incredibly well written and very helpful to gaining an understanding for this subject. The subject is incredibly complex, involves a lot of advanced physics and maths, and covers a lot of material which makes the class seem rather fast paced. The labs involve a lot of work, not so much lab time, but rather a lot of time needs to be spent analyzing lab results and constructing graphs using Matlab (or Python if you prefer). The homework questions are mostly very difficult and there tend to be a lot of them in a single homework. The great part about this class is that Prof Shealy is available in the mornings everyday at his office to help resolve any questions about the material, the homeworks or the labs. He also set a really easy final which helped to easy our stress. It turns out that this class is not very useful if you're going into digital logic or CS. However, if you're going into analog circuit design, then you must take this class."

It is also the most time consuming class that I have taken, as labs and homeworks take over ten hours to do. The midterm was also challenging, and really tests your knowledge on the low level function of semiconductors. Some people say that this class is the second part of ECE 2100, but that is not really the case. It does require basic circuit knowledge from 2100, but it really builds upon that with lots of semiconductor physics and many equations. Be prepared to work hard in this class, but it is definitely rewarding to understand basic electronic components on a deeper level, and is useful for many later analog and digital classes."

The tests felt to me like way easier 3100 tests with with very slight 4271 knowledge required. They almost all questions were multiple choice/true false and worth a fair number of points.

Professor Alexander is very good at explaining concepts and always willing to help."

She has different grading rules than the other prof teaching it in the same semester and it's not fair. The hw assignments have 3 attempts and she takes the average instead of the highest score like the other professor does. And she doesn't give out A+ in this class."

All the questions are so long too with lots of computations. It isn't that difficult but its so monotonous and braindead my brain feels smooth and my IQ feels like it halved. His exams are awful too.

There is a big group project which you will work on throughout the entire semester, with groups made randomly. This can be annoying like all group projects have the potential to be. However, econometrics is very important to economics work so I would recommend it. Although, probably not good for corporate interested business students who are not interested in policy or academic economics."

Personally, it seemed like it was difficult to feel like you completely grasped all of the concepts of the class after one semester though."

The class has a decent amount of reading, but you will read very diverse books from a variety of poc.  The essays are also really fun and he gives amazing feedback. Totally recommend."

Just be prepared to actively engage in discussion because the class is very heavily discussion-based where students lead the conversation and Dr. Green kind of just listens and helps facilitate.

Tedious dogsht assignments, boring lectures where she spends sweet time reading straight off the slides and disregarding all the concepts in the textbook about engaging slides that she LITERALLY MAKES US READ and QUIZZES us on it, and the busywork in-class assignments that she makes us do... this is the moment when I realized that I'm not at this shthole for quality education; I'm here to buy a trendy Cornell degree. I really should've gone to a state school or something, not because I can't handle myself here, but because my state school has a higher quality of education and thus more bang for my buck. There's no point in living if you think about it still, but I suppose I must go on for a slim chance where I get to actually do something I want for once."

In this course you start with learning C in the first half, then you transition to C++. In this class, I felt like I like I learned so much. I learned about multi-paradigm programming - procedural, objected oriented, generic, functional and a little bit of concurrent programming. You also learn about static and dynamic polymorphism. Highly recommend this course with Christopher Batten."

Probably one of the best classes to take if you're ECE and want to learn software (for both software engineering jobs or even just as an ECE out and about in the field you should definitely know C and C++), or even a CS major who wants to learn C and C++. Batten is an amazing lecturer but he is also detailed orriented so you gotta make sure you check everything and really solidify your understanding of the material. You definitely come out a much better programmer, very confident in my abilities now.         BUT you go through war to get there. Just be prepared to grind through the reports at the end of each programming assignments. Exams are tough, but also if I showed up to class on time maybe they'd be aiight. If punctuality isn't your thing this class probably isn't for you."

Thank God this man is finally old enough to call it quits, otherwise you would've been guaranteed to rip your hair out every Wednesday in Rhodes for a complete semester.

If you're already self-motivated and do extra practice on your own, this class probably won't help you much, and just keep doing extra practice.

This is absolutely not an ENGRI and should not be offered to freshman without prerequisites. \n\nIf you have already taken Mechanics, E&M and some amount of calculus, this class will be alright for you. If you have prior understanding of quantum mechanics and photonics then you're chillin as well. It's shocking how many kids in my class actually had that background, and the curve of the class is skewed to that as well. \n\nI came in with very weak understanding of physics and alright with the math, and did not do amazing in the class. Avoid this course all costs if you do not have a technical background, but Prof Xu seems like a chiller.\n\nHomework is always really tough and has questions that have never been covered in lecture. It's a classic AEP style 'figure it out yourself or with your friends/TAs' and that is just the wrong approach to an ENGRI. Exams are tough but ok if you understood the homework and the labs are run very poorly but graded kinda nicely."

Prof Xu is a chill guy and really nice, but I cannot recommend especially if you come from a less-advantaged high school."

I will say, with so many lecturers switching off, it was a little disorganized (lecturers didn't always know what was/wasn't covered before them) and the exams were often a bit vague and difficult to prepare for. The TAs are always very helpful though if you take the time to ask. Almost all of your grade is only based on two exams and one paper, so just be a little careful with that as well.

Professor Langwick doesn't allow laptops and she makes you print out the reading for every class and it is around 10 pages. It was bad for the environment. Also there are pop quizzes for the readings. I took it spring 2020 so the second half was impacted by COVID and there was a lot less work."

Online daily homework is very easy. Textbook is expensive, save money and get the online version (sadly you have to buy the pass for the online homework so you won't be able to get away with buying nothing).

If you haven't sewn before, this class will be the perfect speed for you if you pay attention to the demos. If you have sewn clothing before, this class will be easier. You should be able to get all the projects done in class for the most part. If you find yourself with extra time, definitely work on your own stuff."

Sometimes, I couldn't tell if what a student was saying was good analysis because he was inclined to encourage us to talk, even if we were wrong.

Topics are super interesting as well; I signed up for Nation and State where we learned about well, nations and states and how they interact with each other and all that stuff. Super fascinating; if it wasn't for this class, I wouldn't have known that Egypt and Syria were one country under an Arab nationalist regime during the late 50s. 10/10 would recommend."

I would say sometimes the lectures get a bit dry because a lot of the content would be a repeat from the readings; however I do really enjoy the lectures (as a summary of each lecture topic) when he talks about different case studies like the yellow vest movement, Korean chaebols, Germany's regional tensions, etc. Van de Walle is a very nice professor, he's like your nice grandpa that can tell you a lot of good stories about world politics, and he pauses throughout the lecture to ask if anyone have questions. It is helpful to look at the powerpoint slides before the prelims, and prelims itself are very straightforward as long as you study. I had no homework from sections, as long as I did the readings and discussed about it during class, I did fine."

The readings are really dense and not super interesting, same with the lectures even though van de Walle is awesome as a person. Your experience and grade in the class also depends a lot on your TA; my section was graded a lot harder than others and required more weekly homework than other sections (who had no homework). My opinion of the class is probably a little jaded since I prefer technical classes, but my friends who took the class with me who are gov majors feel similarly about it."

Class is not too bad; sometimes the legal reasoning can get a little convoluted (especially in terms of tort law) so make sure you follow with the readings and lectures. Grade primarily is based on two hypothetical problem sets, in which you are presented with a set of facts and must apply legal reasoning/facts from cases in the readings to your own set of facts. Would suggest you go to office hours for assistance as these are graded pretty harshly. Overall, the class is not impossible but make sure you get help if you need it."

In addition, Prof. Chutkow is honestly the best professor I've had at Cornell -- she's always able to present the material in an engaging and relevant way and makes lecture 100% worth going to. There are two case analysis homework assignments, occasional section meetings that substitute for lectures, and multiple-choice exams. Definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken."

Discussion-based seminar so participation really matters but he makes this easy by assigning a reasonable amount of reading and guiding the discussion when necessary. Obviously cares about his students and rewards effort. Govt class, but he teaches without bias and encourages students to think critically about the material. The workload was better than most 3000-level class I've taken, which says a lot because this is a 4000-level senior seminar. Assigned about 100 pages of reading a week on a topic that we then spent class discussing. 50% of grade from weekly 1 page reactions to readings + class participation and 50% from a 20-page paper about effectively whatever you want. Median grade for class was an A."

Roberts is a really nice prof, super personable, and I enjoyed hearing about his life experiences. The course content is kind of boring, and I didn't do as well as I thought I would on the exams. However, I can attribute this to the fact that as a non-hotelie, I was not experienced in or learning excel (in other hotel courses, like i realized other hotelies did). Being able to use excel well is the key to doing well in this class on exams, and I didn't realize how useful excel was for the course until later. As a non-hotelie, it's hard to get to know people in the class since everybody is already friends/knows each other from other hotel courses. The course content was pretty boring/dry, but gave me a good window/overview into what the hotel major is like. The hotel practicum was interesting though, as I got to see how the Statler hotel worked. The class wasn't hard but I ended up not getting that great of a grade bc I didn't have the same supporting coursework as the hotelies did to help me with this class. Prof Dave Roberts was really nice, and classes were a chill/fun environment. Recommend this course if you're thinking about transferring to the hotel school (i ended up not transferring)."

I love the way he teaches as it really engages the students while we learn about the operations of the hotel industry. We are supposed to have an in person practicum where we do 6-7 hours of work in the Hotel, but it was online this semester because of COVID. Although I missed this opportunity to do it, the class taught me a lot of things that are applicable for future experiences."

It might be because I am the type that likes the flipped class model, which means that you learn what you need for class BEFORE class begins and you do the assignment during class. I took this during COVID so it was online and we had 1-1.5 days to start and finish the full assignment, but during normal semester, I heard students had to start and finish the assignemnts during class. This class is graded on a curve, so if you want a good grade, make sure to do all assignments and exams well or you will be dragged down."

The final exam included the Microsoft Office Specialist exam, where we had to study some of the excel basics. Overall, this was a workload heavy, but not too challenging class. We were given the option to start assignments before our lab day, and I would definitely recommend trying to complete most of the project by the night before. The prelim were multiple choice and open book and the weekly lectures related to Management Information Systems. I will definitely use what I learned in this course in the future."

It might be because I am the type that likes the flipped class model, which means that you learn what you need for class BEFORE class begins and you do the assignment during class. I took this during COVID so it was online and we had 1-1.5 days to start and finish the full assignment, but during normal semester, I heard students had to start and finish the assignemnts during class. This class is graded on a curve, so if you want a good grade, make sure to do all assignments and exams well or you will be dragged down."

I was even recommending my non-Hotelie friends to take HADM 2740. Andrew can be pretty dry but at least he's really clear and easy to follow, and if you fall behind the course packet is very comprehensive. Do your best in this class and it will help you out in other classes like 2010 and 3010, especially during the Excel portions."

The final exam included the Microsoft Office Specialist exam, where we had to study some of the excel basics. Overall, this was a workload heavy, but not too challenging class. We were given the option to start assignments before our lab day, and I would definitely recommend trying to complete most of the project by the night before. The prelim were multiple choice and open book and the weekly lectures related to Management Information Systems. I will definitely use what I learned in this course in the future."

Professor Lakhani teaches with a mixture of lecture and discussion DURING class, which I enjoyed because I learn better by talking and bouncing ideas back and forth. Your final grade is based on 4 assignments weighted equally. 2 prelims, 1 project, and participation. You definitely need to paritciapte +2 times each class or speak in the discussion (took this class during COVID) to receive full participation points for each week. I honestly think I learned a lot about HRM and it made me realzie this is a possible career path for me to take."

It prepares you to be a really good evaluator of marketing research as well if you are interested in the corporate world.

People are always dropping and shattering their glasses and I always feel paranoid about my glasses dropping too. we also can't sit next to friends.

There's a lot of sections each semester and it's only 7 weeks so it's pretty easy to fit into your schedule."

All she really wanted from you was participating and to do your readings. Although she does really look closely at your essays so you have to actually put some work into those. The course material about alternative health was also super interesting but a lot of the conversations we had in the class were students just bashing all alternative health. If you are actually interested in alternative health it could be hard to digest that, but other than that super chill FWS!"

Concepts are very conceptual and do not really require mathematics except for calculating the future value of specialized education investment.

All the questions are so long too with lots of computations. It isn't that difficult but its so monotonous and braindead my brain feels smooth and my IQ feels like it halved. His exams are awful too. There are like 1 million formulas but then he only tests you on like 4 of them. What a waste of my time to study. If you have to take it, take it S/U and save yourself the headache."

When I first joined, I was thinking of dropping because I didn't do great in the homework (it's a mixture of math and probability and policy) and all of said things are not my forte. However, something I realized later after talking with the professors is that you can basically check if you are heading in the right direction for the homework by asking TAs in office hours. They will really help so I see no reason to do poorly in the class if you visit office hours. Also, the final exam is basically just structured like two homeowrks also you can get office hour help on it which is great. Manageable workload, recommend going to office hours and doing homework with friends."

Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable.

I do not feel that I learn a lot as a ux designer and that there is not too much I can do, as most of the game assets are from character art."

There are readings, which are usually links to newspapers or magazine articles, for every class and use Twitter to comment on the readings. There are a lot of different things that you have to submit through out the semester -- essays, discussion posts, tweets on reading in addition to prelims, and it's very easy to lose track.

At the time when I took it, I didn't think that the class was very useful. However, after a data science internship over the summer and taking ML and NLP right now, holy shit this class was useful and really prepared me well. My python/numpy/DS programming skills improved like crazy from this class and the ML projects are a piece of cake for me now, plus I learned lots of useful tricks that have been extremely useful for NLP that I wouldn't have known otherwise. I gained a good intuition for a lot of the stuff we are doing in ML and NLP as well that has made it easier to learn \"formally\" in those classes. Just wanted to express my gratitude and recommend this course for any CS/Infosci students interested in data science, especially as a precursor for ML/NLP (and probably computer vision too)."

There are a few coding/vue assignments and a lot of design assignments, but the design assignments may be fairly redundant if you have knowledge of the design process and have worked on UX projects before. The professor is very passionate but that can come off as intimidating sometimes. There's a group project where your teammates are randomly assigned. Workload is inconsistent, some weeks (coding assignments) have  a lot of work, while other weeks have fairly little."

I feel like other classes like HCI Studio with Francois teach the same thing over and over again but this class really goes into abstract design methods (feminist design, ethnographic studies, undesign, etc.) that you may not use in industry but are still super interesting to learn about. I'd stay away if this is your first design class though because most of the work is readings and designing a project that may or may not exactly be an app/website. Gilly is one of the most organized professors I've ever met and she's super knowledgable!"

There is constantly so much work to do for this class and it didn't even feel like I was learning or making good use of my time completing the homework assignments. The almost weekly quizzes were also super annoying and very stressful tbh as the voice recordings were meant to be taken in one shot. This was worsened by the fact that I had the 9am section slot (and section is every single day), but even though I had good attendance in my first semester of this class (KOREA 1101), it was so hard to be consistent taking KOREA 1102 \u2014 I think I skipped 13 times throughout the semester as when you hit 14 you get bumped down a third of a letter grade.\n\nLoved the \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8s running section though. They were super friendly + funny and it felt like they genuinely cared about us as students."

As long as you attend lecture and review the content of each lecture before the prelim, it is not hard to get a good grade. The prelims are not cumulative, and there is also an extra credit option. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a liberal studies class that is easy and interesting."

Prelim 2 and the final were take homes, which was nice. Weiss also gives lots of extra credit opportunities."

Although it did require a lot of memorization of sound changes, the lectures followed the textbook very closely so studying wasn't too difficult. Professor Alkire is so nice and extremely knowledgeable about the subject - he had an answer to pretty much every random question brought up in class, and if he didn't, he went to the library for the answer and told us during the next class. Workload is pretty light but there is some rather dense reading. He said at the beginning that \"As long as you show up to lecture and try your best you'll get a good grade.\" Material is super interesting if you like romance languages. I've never really been a phonetics/phonology person but this class may have changed that - our relative chronology problems are actually pretty fun. The final is a take-home exam and there's a couple of quizzes, in-class exercises, and short homeworks."

Lectures are hard to follow and he likes to ramble, and will occasionally lose his train of thought. However, the slides are also hard to understand, and there are no lecture notes (nor does he really follow the textbook), so you have to go to lecture. The class is quite disorganized, and homework/prelim grades took forever to be released. The class also seems to be focused much more on teaching how to use specific software tools to create/analyze linguistic models, rather than the theory behind how such software tools work (which is what I was more interested in). On the plus side though, he is rather lenient in giving final grades, so I still ended up with a B+ even though I kinda gave up on the class 2/3 through."

This class is very linguistics focused too and you use software mostly to do linguistics stuff EX: foma. The hard part is coming up with grammar etc..."

More than half the psets (which were actually coding projects except for a few written questions) took more than 20 hours, although the short ones took a range of 1 to 5 hours. There were 7 psets total.  This is a predominantly CS class although it's cross-listed in LING and COGST. The lectures were interesting, but the projects (psets) were extremely frustrating, and the professor and the TA gave out obscure answers when asking for help.  I'm also not sure how much I learned from the projects. I ended up with a good grade, which is based on the projects and some participation, but wouldn't have taken it if I had to choose again.  Definitely know a friend you can discuss with or get to know someone if you take the class."

The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been."

Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material."

The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP."

The homework was lengthy, but the discussions were helpful with understanding material not covered in class.

That being said, there was a lot of new information and the way they want you to answer questions, specifically on homeworks, can take time getting used to. The structure of the class was weird, small classes where people have different TAs teaching them. Dr. Ramkumar was a very friendly and knowledgeable TA. I think in general though it is taught poorly. For some reason they introduce an idea to you, and have you struggle to see if you can solve a problem (which you end up needing the new concept you are about to learn to solve). After a long time of this, you learn a new concept only to go through 1 or 2 practice problems before the class is over. This was extremely frustrating because it would feel like you barely learned anything in class. Additionally, homework assignments which were due at the end of the week were based on the previous weeks Lecture content, so not only would you barely learn the content, but you would also revisit it a week later without having practiced it in the meantime. Homeworks were also graded for accuracy which I found stupid. Only got an A- because of prior Calculus knowledge. You definitely need to use out of class resources to succeed."

Exams were fairly difficult. Cao wasn't that great at teaching in my opinion. Sometimes, too much time was spent doing long theoretical proofs that weren't necessary for understanding/doing well on HWs and the exams. Although, there were a few theory/proof based questions spread out through the exams in the course - maybe 1 or 2 per exam. The course is mostly applications-based/practical with some theory sprinkled in, but you can get by without understanding it if it's not your thing. Cao's teaching/notes during lecture weren't great, so I just used the notes of profs/TAs from other sections on canvas."

Since the concepts usually weren't too difficult until the end, I would say the class isn't too hard to do well in as long as you complete and understand the homework. This quizzes were always an easy question from the homework, I usually finished within a minute or so. The first two exams were much easier than the final, though, so that was a bit of a shock. You also get 3 quiz drops and homework extensions if needed and requested on time. Overall, this was a good course and hopefully helpful for taking 1920 in the spring semester."

Anecdotally, there were several dropouts. The support course is an excellent resource, although the practice problems are much easier than what is found on exams. \nThe workload was not bad, 10 homework assignments and of course, study hard before prelims and final. It's a taste of what proof-based math is really like. Computational math like calculus I/II, in my opinion, is a different skillset. Take it only if you want a more rigorous challenge vs MATH 2940."

In order to do well in this class you NEED to do well on the quizzes and I recommend front loading \nyour 3s to the best of your ability as PDEs get difficult and the final exam gives basically no partial credit so it\u2019s vital to come in with as many LOs complete as possible."

In fact, much of the workload felt like little more than number-crunching - easy, but annoying. I had high hopes for this class - talking to other, more math-oriented people, I often hear things like how beautiful linear algebra is. This class disappointed me, as I feel like I got very little of that abstractness that I value math for in the first place.

I never really felt like the lectures or homework helped me study for exams beyond core concepts; practice exams were my best friend, and I essentially went blind into quizzes. My main problem with the course is that grades lacked transparency \u2014 no medians/means were released for any assignments or exams and I had virtually no clue how the class would be curved throughout the year, which was very disorienting."

Professor Aguiar can be a little boring in lecture sometimes, but his notes are really good and well organised, and will tell you everything you need to know to do the homeworks and the exams.

A lot of lectures consist of him reading the text (that he wrote and uploads to blackboard) or original materials, and explaining them. The material starts from Euclid (don't buy the textbook, it's just Euclid's Elements which is available online, and we basically didn't use it) and explains the development of mainly geometry and algebra up until Galois theory. The problem sets also aren't too difficult but can be long and tedious (there's around 9-10). A third of your grade is based on the presentation, where you choose a topic and give a 20+ min lecture to the class on basically anything related to the history of math. Attendance was mandatory when there were student presentations. Overall fairly interesting and a pretty chill class, but I guess it's not for everyone."

Since the readings are from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the old Spanish used is different from modern-day Spanish and is much more difficult to understand. The class also included a lot of class discussions which was difficult for me since many of the other students were native speakers."

You then get a really detailed report with quantitative and qualitative feedback about you. that alone made this class worth it.

However, the class can get a bit boring and we always get out on time or late. There isn't too much homework and the concepts are pretty easy but they don't grade very leniently. More instruction could have been given for homeworks and projects as it was pretty unclear a lot of the time. Given how the class is structured, 98.00% needed for an A+ (no rounding) and extra credit is only worth 0.1% and takes a long time to complete. There is only few major assignments (1 midterm, 1 final project, a few writing assignments) so your grade is almost solely determined on a few things. Its a good class but def not as easy as it used to be."

I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised! I looked forward to this class every week as a stress-reliever. I especially enjoyed the TA (Kendall McAdams) and his humorous but informative demonstrations. My only complaints about this class are the relatively-fast pace (this is a survey class of ballroom dance after all) and the fact that this class only meets once a week."

Beware of any dance class where you need to hold hands with a dance partner - lots of hand sweat. Also very frequent partner switching, so don't join the class expecting to get a lot of dancing time with a friend. You can only miss two classes, which makes for not a ton of leeway in attendance. All in all, classes are not the most exciting but the music is good and you do get to tell people you know swing dancing when you're done, so maybe it's worth it."

We would walk to different spots on campus, like the botanical gardens, or to the suspension bridge and then find a place to spread out as a group (masks on and distanced) and do some stretching and meditation. We had to talk with each other a lot while walking or at the locations which was really nice. She'd teach us about mindfulness and methods of taking care of ourselves through the stretching and meditations, and then we would journal for like 15 minutes. Then walk back to HNH. Very easy class, very worth it, I had a great time and it really got me out of my room and to explore new places on campus, while also taking care of myself, very great option during these times. We had planned to go online when the weather got cold but then the instructor Priscilla got us into HNH and we used the gym and dance studio which was really cool. Priscilla was also one of the coolest people I've ever met, highly recommend this class."

If you wanted to spend most of your time learning a lot of techniques and doing drills, however, this is not the class. Most days are spent doing some type of game. We start out the class doing \"around the world\" where you have to hit the ball to the other side of the net and then run over to the other side to do it again. The hard part isn't hitting, it's the running! Towards the end of the semester, you finally can refine your skills enough to have decent rallies and the games become more fun. The only downside of this class can be the instructor. He can sometimes be funny, but he can be one real nut job. He is not shy in expressing his views about COVID-19 and about the mask mandate. He will occasionally call everyone in the class over to let us know to never trust the media or Big Pharma. Regardless of what you think about his opinions it really doesn't have any place to be discussed in a tennis class and can sometimes be really annoying. If you try to question him on this, he will get very mad and start to debate you, he even has a printed-out script that he will read to kids about how the pandemic is not real. However, aside from the instructor, the class can be very fun, and you will get a workout running around."

The first few times you experiment with getting stabbed, you might feel slightly sore, but you'll be wearing protective padding with the tunics. And once you're actually in a match, the heat of the moment + adrenaline will make you completely forget the slight discomfort. \n\nThis class is really fun and I hope they do an intermediate level class soon!"

Alice is VERY strict about punctuality. Two kids in the class were like 3 minutes late after lunch break and she made them wait outside for a bit and then let them back in but they weren't able to get the certification (still got PE credit), so keep that in mind.

There's a class on Tuesday to go shopping for clothes and get whatever gear you need from COE (Cornell Outdoor Education), which is not mandatory if you already have everything you need. Finally, on Friday you get in a van and drive out to the Schenectady area to camp for the night, and continue camping there as you go in a cave on Saturday and a different one on Sunday. The caves were beautiful, and it was a blast crawling, climbing, and exploring them. My instructors, Sylvan and Kaitlyn, were extremely helpful, kind, and knowledgable, and made sure everyone was safe and secure at all times. I would highly recommend that anyone who is physically and financially able to take this course does. Just make sure you're in at least somewhat of good shape and can handle several hours at a time exploring a cave."

Unfortunately, Professor Korzukhin's lecture were quiet and hard to follow. The lecture slides were also not shared in order to encourage students to show up to class, but not having them as a resource when studying for exams definitely made the class a lot harder. The readings were not bad in difficulty so if you're looking for an introduction to philosophy, just reading about philosophy in your spare time might be a better option."

The professor's (Shaun Nichols) lecture slides are hard to follow when you're reviewing on your own, the professor also uploaded amendments to the slides for the final exam a DAY BEFORE the final exam- never in my career at Cornell have I seen such flippancy from a professor. The student doesn't get to know their grade until after the drop deadline which is also extremely considerate, and the student has to chase down TAs to get grades back (which the student receives about a month later). TA's quality is extremely variable so it depends on your luck there. The professor doesn't recognize that most of the students in this class are juniors and seniors taking this class for a distribution requirement- they picked this class because they thought it'd be interesting! Sadly, I'm turned off from philosophy"

Imo attending office hours is pretty important if you want them to grade your paper favorably, it also gives you an idea of what they're looking for in an essay which is not always clear during class. Overall they're a pretty approachable professor when it comes to essay help/flexibility on deadlines. Feedback may seem harsh at first but the grading itself isn't so bad and there are opportunities for extra credit. This class was interesting and somewhat thought provoking, but involved a fair bit of reading with sometimes dense or confusing texts."

Given that the content is difficult at time it would be nice if they took you through it\n\nThey will give you an A+ if you do a good job, the bar for quality of writing is really not that high. You will get a B if you're not slightly locked in.\n\nOverall super good class, totally take it if you wanna learn some interesting stuff about sex/romantic relationships/kinks"

However, Alex goes through them with the class & kind of drills it into your head until you get it, so you don't need to know about Philosophy going in. Grading was extremely light & everyone got As for doing the work. One of the best classes I've ever taken & Alex himself is a deeply entertaining guy -- and a great lecturer.

The entire lecture is pretty much clicker questions and examples, so if you don't do the reading you won't know what's going on. Jeevak Parpia was not the best lecturer but if you study the textbook material you will do fine."

Even then, the class remained hard to achieve a good grade, just based on not being able to miss very many points at all (you can calculate your grade as you go in the course). Do not take this class alongside other very challenging courses, as it takes a lot of time to complete. In spring 2018, they changed course policies to make it slightly less time-consuming, but learning the material on your own does take awhile. That being said, TA's (both undergraduate and graduate) are very helpful to ensure that you are focusing on what you should for exams and labs. Professor Taylor and Professor Giambatista are very nice and willing to meet with you to help you improve in the course."

The textbook wasn't much help either. The TA was fantastic, and I learned a lot from the discussion sections. There was a problem set each week which took me 4-5 hours. It was extremely difficult, and it seemed like it was intended to compel you to go to the weekly \"homework parties\" (lengthy, optional class study sections held once a week with the professor, TA, and UTAs). I couldn't really ever do it without help. Additionally, there were weekly discussion section quizzes with a 15-minute time limit, which was kind of tough, but I don't think they affect the overall grade much."

The overwhelming opinion from the students is that yes, the class is hard, you may not understand the physics, but you will love the professor and the way the class is run. Ryan truly listens to his students. He takes our feedback into account and explains why he is running the course the way he is. He has moved back deadlines for the whole class when students said that they have a stressful week with other prelims / courses. The exams were extremely fair, and the gradings scale is very forgiving. 50% of the grade is just showing up to lecture and turning in the homework. The cut-off for an A- was 85%. Going into the class, I was really nervous because everyone had horror stories and told me to take it at a different college for transfer credit. Ryan Tapping is actively making a difference and trying to change that! Take this class with him!"

The homework is a lot of derivation that is not at all relevant in exams (I guess they're just trying to make you understand) but coops and quizzes are helpful.

The material was spaced out pretty well (although you do have to do the textbook readings or you will fall behind). Problem sets were not super time consuming. I didn't find the prelims to be that hard (although they were in class so we only had 50 minutes to complete them - it was a pretty nasty time crunch, and I never had time to check my work), but the average was very low (we were given points back and curved to a higher grade though)."

And there are no good waves textbook, except for a draft of one at http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/djmorin/book.html  (insert a tilde before djmorin).                              Our homework problems were all challenging, so we had no basic or \"think-inside-the-box\" questions, which made it really difficult to gauge how well I understood the material. Recitation (and its quizzes) was our only place to solidify understanding. Exams were reasonable. The last third of the course is thermo, which is a \"new leaf\" and the textbook and homework were great.                                        Labs are a joke as always (on the honors track at least). The project lab is kinda cool, especially if you like experimental physics - you're given two months to design and present any experiment, completely open-ended.

Professor Jeff is genuinely empathetic and understanding, which is a big plus considering the class spans seven hours a week. The course offers access to expensive equipment, presenting a fantastic opportunity for hands-on learning, though there's the responsibility of covering costs for any damages. If you have spare time and are interested in creating your own short film, I'd highly recommended this class. The actual filming only occurs in the last month, which can be a bit frustrating, but that's when most of the practical learning happens. Despite his teaching style being more lecture-based and not always effective, the unique experience of a film class makes it worth considering."

First few quizzes will be tough as you get used to the format of the questions but 2 lowest quizzes get dropped.

You don't need to do the readings (unless you're confused and need further background information) because she explains what you need to know in class. She gives you a review sheet of all the questions you need to know for the exam and if you memorize that, you're all set for the exam. It's a low key class. I didn't enjoy it though because the class consist of only lectures with minimal discussion/input from students and the logic used for these infant/children studies just don't make sense to me."

While attendance is not recorded, he covers a lot of information that isn't on the slides, so I would highly recommend attending (and I enjoyed these lectures. There were weekly quizzes on readings (interesting reads, mostly about experiments). Prelims were somewhat lengthy, but he provides a list of topics prior and I don't remember any questions being big surprises (i.e. they were mentioned in the outline document)."

Prelims were lowkey mad hard because there's so much information to learn, but I didn't study much so that's on me. Goldstein's study guides are extremely long but cover pretty much everything u need to know for the exam. If you're interested in psych but not interested in the science side of it I recommend taking another course."

For my class, he did not assign homework and only had three prelims and a final essay, which were all writing-based. As long as you attend lecture and review the content of each lecture before the prelim, it is not hard to get a good grade. The prelims are not cumulative, and there is also an extra credit option. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a liberal studies class that is easy and interesting."

The workload for this class isn't bad: two multiple choice exams, a quiz, and a final.

Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable.

The content is not difficult to understand. Highly recommend this course!"

I took it during covid so exams were online which likely made them easier, but even without that I think it would be a pretty low effort and fun class."

Professor Edelman wrote the textbook that you have to buy, then quoted himself in the lecture slides that he wrote as if he didn't write the textbook. This entire discipline seemed like something that he made up himself so he could teach a class about it and hear himself talk. Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable. Don't go to lecture because it is painfully boring to sit through and do the readings before the exam and hope for the best. But also just don't take this class."

A virtual semester consists of small weekly readings with annotations on Perusall and a weekly micro essay about the topic of the week with a max of 500 words. Topics are really interesting and light work kept me motivated, but I could see how a semester with prelims and finals could make the content seem tedious."

Her PowerPoints are very sparse and don't make sense, so you need those notes. You don't need to do the readings (unless you're confused and need further background information) because she explains what you need to know in class. She gives you a review sheet of all the questions you need to know for the exam and if you memorize that, you're all set for the exam. It's a low key class. I didn't enjoy it though because the class consist of only lectures with minimal discussion/input from students and the logic used for these infant/children studies just don't make sense to me."

There were weekly quizzes on readings (interesting reads, mostly about experiments).

Goldstein's study guides are extremely long but cover pretty much everything u need to know for the exam.

I never really learned about Dante or his work before, and this class not only taught me about Inferno, but also the mindset of reading with intention that can be applied to much more than just this literature. Additionally, professor does spend a lot of one-on-one time with the students (if you are willing and actually schedule the meetings) to improve writing. Honestly, I think my idea of writing and ability has much improved over the semester, especially as she teaches a much better view than what high school teachers are able to explain. Overall, I would totally take this class again, I'd just recommend maybe some knowledge about christian religion as I had none, but it may be useful for the class. Even though I didn't start with the knowledge, I did learn over the course and was able to do fine. The only small downside, I'd say, is the workload of completing journals for each class and essay deadlines springing up, but it's not too bad compared to other courses, and the journals are technically only due by the end of the semester (but do them on time!)"

However, she will give a lot of feedback and help you get better. The class itself was interesting and IEA knew a lot about what she was saying. Overall, do not take this class expecting an easy A, but if you put in the work and clearly try to improve, she will give you a good grade and you'll learn a fair amount. Def more than what other FWS's are work-wise though."

She doesn't grade the essays so you only know your final grade after sem ends but should be relatively easy to get an A as long as you put in the work."

Although it did require a lot of memorization of sound changes, the lectures followed the textbook very closely so studying wasn't too difficult. Professor Alkire is so nice and extremely knowledgeable about the subject - he had an answer to pretty much every random question brought up in class, and if he didn't, he went to the library for the answer and told us during the next class. Workload is pretty light but there is some rather dense reading. He said at the beginning that \"As long as you show up to lecture and try your best you'll get a good grade.\" Material is super interesting if you like romance languages. I've never really been a phonetics/phonology person but this class may have changed that - our relative chronology problems are actually pretty fun. The final is a take-home exam and there's a couple of quizzes, in-class exercises, and short homeworks."

The professor for this class is really nice but be prepared for a relatively difficult class and workload. There is homework due every class (class meets 3 times a week). The workload in this class was quite a lot for me personally. On top of constant hw to learn new grammar, we also had to watch videos in spanish and fill out hw based on comprehension. We would also have exams about every 2 weeks (mix of online prelims, orals, writings, etc). On top of that, we also had to do an exchange with a colombian student, which required a zoom meeting or email every week and a journal entry. The only nice thing about this class compared to SPAN 2090 is that you do a final presentation instead of an exam and both classes probably have a similar workload"

Lectures were mostly just prof going on and on and getting so theoretical that it just wasn't engaging. Grade depends completely on ur TA.

Professor Langwick doesn't allow laptops and she makes you print out the reading for every class and it is around 10 pages. It was bad for the environment. Also there are pop quizzes for the readings. I took it spring 2020 so the second half was impacted by COVID and there was a lot less work."

Final exam was worth 45% of our grade and was not cumulative, so all of the material that she rushed through in the last 2 weeks makes a huge impact on your grade."

Weekly quizzes, and 3 wine review papers that require at least 1 journal. Super easy and not a lot of time required for this class. 10 extra credit points total, so you can get up to 110.

The professors are both clearly very invested in what they're teaching! Each week had a separate theme (one was tea ceremonies) and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about all of the topics. There's very little work during the semester (just weekly readings) and 1-3 essays (including the final). I wasn't too sure on what they were looking for on the papers but going into office hours was very helpful to see how I could improve for the final."

Only a few assignments and the professor is really understanding."

There's two prelims and one final -- and for all of these, he'll give you a question bank out of which questions will be picked. There's a few (around 5-6) easy in-class quizzes at random points, so it's good to attend class though not crucial. You can get by without going to class, but I'd highly recommend going to class because it's very interesting!"

The content is not difficult to understand. Highly recommend this course!"
