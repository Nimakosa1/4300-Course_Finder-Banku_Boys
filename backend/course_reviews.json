I found the clsss to be disorganized and the lectures to be boring. I also had trouble with every single project and had a hard time finding good help. I am sure that the materials are helpful for CS majors (or minors), and they proabbly could be interesting if you like it. But as someone who is not a CS person, I really struggled in the class and did not have a good time :(("
